	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p> I earned my Bachelor of Mathematics with a Computational Mathematics major and a Computer Science minor at the University of Waterloo. My program taught me how to be a logical thinker and assess all solutions to reach the optimal solution with the best outcome for a problem in the end. Iâ€™ve also learned to be a more patient person, especially through debugging and creating the right algorithm as it can be quiet tedious at times. In my spare time, I like to read, listen to music or workout.
