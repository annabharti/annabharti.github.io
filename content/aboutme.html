	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p> I’m in my last year at the University of Waterloo, studying Computational Mathematics and Computer Science. My current program has taught me how to be a logical thinker and assess all solutions to reach the optimal solution with the best outcome for a problem in the end. I’ve also learned to be a more diligent worker especially through my computer science courses which helped me to realize that even the smallest of mistakes can give me the wrong results like let’s say forgetting to put a semi colon or closing the brackets in the code can cause it to not run as expected. I’ve also learned to be a more patient person, especially through debugging and creating the right algorithm as it can be quiet tedious at times. In my spare time, I like to read, listen to music or workout.
